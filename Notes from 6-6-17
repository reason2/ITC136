/home/<user>/ (can branch off to other folders i.e. "Share/public"; "Desktop"; "Videos"; "Documents"; "Pictures"; "Music", etc.)
/tmp (location of other files)
/etc/ (System config, Ssh server)
/var/ (log, mail, spool, cops) Semi-permanent files (constantly being updated)
/etc/ (System config, Ssh server)
/etc/ssh (bin=user binaries); (sbin=system binary); (lib=libraries); (share=fonts/pics)
Multiple levels of files system:
  a - no prefix; (/bin; /sbin; /lib) = base functionality
  b - user prefix;(/usr/sbin) = functioning with users
  c - user local prefix (/usr/local/lib/bin) = locally complied programs
how would u find out where a binary is - (cmd = "whereis ifconfig")
can also use "which" to find a single output vs whereis giving u multiple
"locate ifconfig" gives u location of config file 
dev = devices and device 
locate = accurately tell u where files are; only as current as last time it ran
whereis = incomplete info but will show as much as possible w/in that path multiple outputs
